	<h1>The wine</h1>

	

	<p>The Rangoon <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Articles/StandardCSSProperties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001266--webkit-border-radius">was moored</a>
 half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the 
mast-head. Eleven o’clock was striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance 
of time.</p>

	

	<blockquote><p>Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment.</p></blockquote>

	

	<p>“<q cite="http://www.fillerati.com">The rascal is off, after all!</q>” he exclaimed. “Two thousand pounds sacrificed! He’s as prodigal <a href="http://www.css3files.com/smashing-winery/location.html">as a thief</a>!
 I’ll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate 
he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted.”</p>



	<h2>Blue grapes</h2>

	<p>The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture. Since 
leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of 
the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than 
five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum recovered
 from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly 
diminishing.</p>



	<h2>Our wines</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Red wine</li>

		<li>White wine</li>

		<li>Rosé</li>

	</ul>

	

	<p>The Rangoon-one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company’s boats 
plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas-was a screw steamer, built of 
iron, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, and with 
engines of four hundred horse-power. She was as fast, <a href="http://www.yetanotherwebsite.com/">but not as well</a> fitted up, as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished.</p>

	<h2>What a view</h2>

	

	<p>Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the
 Sons of the Sun. He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for 
his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama. He found
 himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses having 
low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he caught …</p>
